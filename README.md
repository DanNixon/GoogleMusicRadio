GoogleMusicRadio
================
Internet radio which streams music form a Google Play library using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

Overview
--------
Allows browsing and playing tracks from a Google Play music library on a hardware internet radio, browsing library is done through a Artist>Album>Track menu structure (or a Playlist>Track structure in the case of playlists).

The radio is intended to be used with [Last.fm](http://last.fm) to report the currently playing track, scrobble listened tracks and to love tracks at the request of the user.

A basic user interface of 6 buttons, two rotary encoders with push in switches and a 4 row, 20 column LCD is used, although it is possible to use various sizes of LCD based on specific user requirements enclosure designs.

Requirements
------------
Libraries required for Arduino and Raspberry Pi are listed in the respective folders.

Build Instructions
------------------
A complete guide to building a radio is currently being produced on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/), I will update this file when I have published it, however you may check [here](http://www.instructables.com/member/DanNixon/) to see if it is published in the meantime.
